      Yes, the rob-in's nest had

      been robbed&mdash;their own
    </p>
    <p>
      rob-in's nest un-der the bush,
    </p>
    <p>
      with its dar-ling lit-tle eggs of
    </p>
    <p>
      the true robin's blue! The

    </p>
    <p>
      ped on the ground, and the
    </p>
    <p>
      love-ly eggs were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know well e-nough," said

    <p>
      Beth, "that those were the

    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Bes-sie, sad-ly,

    <p>
      "he and Dick must have found
    </p>
    <p>
      our bush and looked un-der
    </p>
    <p>
      it, and pulled out the nest. If

    </p>
    <p>
      think it ought not to go as if
    </p>
    <p>
      they had done on-ly right! I

    </p>
    <p>
      and the boys got no cards for
    </p>
    <p>
      the cher-ry par-ty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is be-cause you broke up
    </p>
    <p>
      the rob-in's nest," said Bes-sie
    </p>
    <p>
      se-vere-ly. "It is to make you

      Jim-my looked so-ber for a

    <p>
      his heels on the car-pet. "Ho,

      A CHRIST-MAS CAROL, LIT-TLE ROS-A-BEL'S AD-VEN-TURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lit-tle Ros-a-bel liked sto-ries
    </p>
    <p>
      the best of any-thing in the
    </p>
    <p>
      world; and she be-lieved that
    </p>
    <p>
      all her lit-tle pict-ure books
    </p>
    <p>
      were true, and O, how she did
    </p>
    <p>
      wish she were a stor-y-book
    </p>
    <p>
      girl her-self, and that such
    </p>
    <p>
      things would hap-pen to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear lit-tle Ros-a-bel, she used
    </p>
    <p>
      to go out in the green lanes
    </p>
    <p>
      and grass-y dells and hunt for
    </p>
    <p>
      fair-ies, and list-en for talk-ing
    </p>
    <p>
      birds and talk-ing flow-ers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one day lit-tle Ros-a-
    </p>
    <p>
      bel thought she would try one
    </p>
    <p>
      of the sto-ries and see if it
    </p>
    <p>
      would come true with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chose the sto-ry of "Lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Rid-ing-hood," be-cause
    </p>
    <p>
      she had a red hood and be-
    </p>
    <p>
      cause she knew a poor old
    </p>
    <p>
      wom-an who lived a-lone in an
    </p>
    <p>
      old house. So she put a pat
    </p>
    <p>
      of but-ter and a cust-ard-pie in
    </p>
    <p>
      a lit-tle bask-et, tied on her red
    </p>
    <p>
      hood, and started a-way. But
    </p>
    <p>
      there were no woods to go
    </p>
    <p>
      through, and so no wolf came
    </p>
    <p>
      a-long. Ros-a-bel called "Wolf!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolf!" man-y times, but no
    </p>
    <p>
      wolf came. When she came
    </p>
    <p>
      to the old house she tried to
    </p>
    <p>
      reach the big knock-er. But
    </p>
    <p>
      she couldn't, so she knocked
    </p>
    <p>
      with her lit-tle knuck-les. A
    </p>
    <p>
      ver-y thin, low voice said, "Lift
    </p>
    <p>
      the latch and come right in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ros-a-bel did, and there was a
    </p>
    <p>
      poor old grand-moth-er right in
    </p>
    <p>
      bed, just like the stor-y!
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, have you any-thing to eat
    </p>
    <p>
      in that bask-et?" said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sprained my an-kle
    </p>
    <p>
      and I can't walk, and there has
    </p>
    <p>
      no-bod-y been here for two
    </p>
    <p>
      days, and I am al-most starved,
    </p>
    <p>

      Yes, Ros-a-bel could. A-way

    <p>
      ma and the doc-tor both came,

    <p>
      "Crumbs of Crack-ers" and
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drops of Milk" were, the
    </p>
    <p>
      names of two lit-tle girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you like to know how
    </p>
    <p>
      they got these fun-ny names?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this way: Lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crumbs" was al-ways nib-
    </p>
    <p>
      bling crack-ers, and lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drops" lived up-on noth-
    </p>
    <p>
      ing but milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met for the first
    </p>
    <p>
      time one day by the fence
    </p>
    <p>
      be-tween their gar-dens. Lit-
    </p>
    <p>
      tle Drops was sip-ping from
    </p>
    <p>
      her sil-ver cup and lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      Crumbs was munch-ing her
    </p>
    <p>
      crack-er. The big sun-flower
    </p>
    <p>
      thought there must be a dog
    </p>
    <p>
      and a kit-ty in the gar-den.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen you out here
    </p>
    <p>
      twice," said Crumbs bold-ly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "and both times you was a-
    </p>
    <p>
      drink-ing milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' I's seen you two times,
    </p>
    <p>
      and bofe times you was a-eat-
    </p>
    <p>
      ing cwack-ers!" said Drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lit-tle girls looked
    </p>
    <p>
      at each oth-er through the
    </p>
    <p>
      fence. Bold lit-tle Crumbs
    </p>
    <p>
      spoke first: "I don't like milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I does," said Drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mam-ma says I was
    </p>
    <p>
      brought up on one cow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was you once a tru-ly
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle bos-sy calf?" asked
    </p>
    <p>
      Crumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Drops did not like that
    </p>
    <p>
      ques-tion. "You isn't ber-ry
    </p>
    <p>
      nice to me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Crumbs was sor-ry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her crack-er.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here!" she said. And
    </p>
    <p>
      while Drops nib-bled, Crumbs,
    </p>
    <p>
      to show that she was tru-ly
    </p>
    <p>
      sor-ry, took a sip from the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was tru-ly sor-row
    </p>
    <p>
      in-deed, for Crumbs don't like
    </p>
    <p>
      milk to this day.

      Once there was a lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      girl named I-da, who nev-er

    <p>
      look at this pic-ture ev-er-y day

    <p>
      and wish and wish she could

    </p>
    <p>
      Poor lit-tle

    <p>
      a-bout it, and

    <p>
      one night she
    </p>
    <p>
      cried af-ter she went to bed, and
    </p>
    <p>
      when her moth-er came and
    </p>
    <p>
      asked what was the mat-ter she
    </p>
    <p>
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so mizh-a-ble for a
    </p>
    <p>
      dol-ly, mam-ma!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mam-ma sat up long af-ter
    </p>
    <p>
      her lit-tle girl was a-sleep and
    </p>
    <p>
      thought a-bout it; and the next
    </p>
    <p>
      morn-ing, when I-da woke,
    </p>
    <p>
      there sat a dol-ly on the bu-
    </p>
    <p>
      reau star-ing at her, a queer,
    </p>
    <p>
      queer thing, but I-da knew
    </p>
    <p>
      it was sure-ly a doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great rag ba-by,
    </p>
    <p>
      made of an old sheet, and
    </p>
    <p>
      dressed in one of I-da's pink
    </p>
    <p>
      cal-i-co a-prons, and it had black
    </p>
    <p>
      thread hair, and blue but-ton
    </p>
    <p>
      eyes, a rag nose, and red ink
    </p>
    <p>
      lips&mdash;but oh! how de-li-cious
    </p>
    <p>
      it was to hold, and hug, and
    </p>
    <p>
      love! All the sweet names
    </p>
    <p>
      I-da could think of were giv-en
    </p>
    <p>
      her: "Pret-ty," and "Dar-
    </p>
    <p>
      ling," and "Fair-y," and "Sun-
    </p>
    <p>
      shine." And lit-tle I-da was
    </p>
    <p>
      not "mizh-a-ble" an-y more.

      HOW DAN-NY SAID HE WAS SOR-RY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dan-ny was a hand-some lit-
    </p>
    <p>
      tle boy, but not al-ways a
    </p>
    <p>
      good lit-tle boy. Some-times
    </p>
    <p>
      he was so naught-y that you
    </p>
    <p>
      could see sparks of fire in
    </p>
    <p>
      his soft black eyes, and he
    </p>
    <p>
      would dou-ble his chub-by lit-
    </p>
    <p>
      tle hands up in-to fists, and
    </p>
    <p>
      stamp his feet, and look ex-
    </p>
    <p>
      actly as though he were go-
    </p>
    <p>
      ing to strike some-bod-y.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when mam-ma
    </p>
    <p>
      was sick with head-ache he
    </p>
    <p>
      had one of these bad times
    </p>
    <p>
      with his tem-per.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't wish to walk with
    </p>
    <p>
      El-len," he cried, "an' I won't!
    </p>
    <p>
      I want a play-walk with you,
    </p>
    <p>
      mam-ma! El-len don't talk
    </p>
    <p>
      with me, an' she won't let
    </p>
    <p>
      me drive her at all! I want
    </p>
    <p>
      a play-walk with my mam-ma,
    </p>
    <p>
      I say! Do you hear, mam-ma!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mam-ma heard. She felt
    </p>
    <p>
      as though the naught-y lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      boots had come down with
    </p>
    <p>
      a stamp right on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew ver-y well it was
    </p>
    <p>
      nicer for a lit-tle boy to walk
    </p>
    <p>
      with a mam-ma who would
    </p>
    <p>
      a-muse him and take part in
    </p>
    <p>
      his lit-tle plays, than with a
    </p>
    <p>
      nurse, but she could not go,
    </p>
    <p>
      and when Dan-ny stamped
    </p>
    <p>
      and roared, he had to be sent
    </p>
    <p>
      out of the room quick-ly, and
    </p>
    <p>
      with-out e-ven a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a much-a-shamed
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle boy that went stub-bing
    </p>
    <p>
      a-long in the dust right in
    </p>
    <p>
      the mid-dle of the road a
    </p>
    <p>
      half-hour aft-er. His lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      heart was strug-gling to find
    </p>
    <p>
      some way to say how sor-ry
    </p>
    <p>
      he was. There were no flow-
    </p>
    <p>
      ers to pick for a nose-gay, and
    </p>
    <p>
      it was too late for e-ven a
    </p>
    <p>
      stray black-ber-ry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just be-fore din-ner
    </p>
    <p>
      mam-ma woke, and there was
    </p>
    <p>
      a great cloud of col-or, red
    </p>
    <p>
      and gold, right be-fore her,
    </p>
    <p>
      and shin-ing o-ver it, a pair
    </p>
    <p>
      of silk-en-fringed black eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      so soft and lov-ing and sor-ry
    </p>
    <p>
      that mam-ma gath-ered her
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle boy, and the great arm-
    </p>
    <p>
      ful of au-tumn leaves right
    </p>
    <p>
      in-to her arms, and in one
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle min-ute all the naugh-
    </p>
    <p>
      ti-ness was loved a-way.

      Once on a time&mdash;the story-
    </p>
    <p>
      book time when an-i-mals wore
    </p>
    <p>
      clothes and could talk&mdash;there
    </p>
    <p>
      were three mod-el mice. Their
    </p>
    <p>
      names were Gray Cloak, Fine
    </p>
    <p>
      Ear and Sat-in Slip-per.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0017" id="linkimage-0017"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
      <img src="images/9022.jpg" alt="9022 " width="100%" /><br /><a
      href="images/9022.jpg"><i>enlarge</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Sat-in Slip-per had a spoon of
    </p>
    <p>
      her own, Fine Ear had a knife,
    </p>
    <p>
      and Gray Cloak owned a fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day they thought they
    </p>
    <p>
      would club the knife and the
    </p>
    <p>
      fork and the spoon to-geth-er,
    </p>
    <p>
      and keep house. As they
    </p>
    <p>
      were mod-el mice, they eas-i-ly
    </p>
    <p>
      a-greed where to live. They
    </p>
    <p>
      chose Farm-er Jones' cel-lar,
    </p>
    <p>
      be-cause there were bar-rels of
    </p>
    <p>
      ap-ples, bas-kets of eggs, and
    </p>
    <p>
      shelves loaded with good-ies,
    </p>
    <p>
      and an egg, or an ap-ple, or a
    </p>
    <p>
      stray cake would not be missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lived once," said Gray
    </p>
    <p>
      Cloak, "in the cel-lar of a
    </p>
    <p>
      wom-an who bought by the
    </p>
    <p>
      doz-en or the dime's worth,
    </p>
    <p>
      and she missed the least lit-
    </p>
    <p>
      tle thing at once, so that fi-
    </p>
    <p>
      nal-ly I left in dis-gust."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such good times as those
    </p>
    <p>
      three mice had! The cel-lar
    </p>
    <p>
      had a smooth, wa-ter-limed
    </p>
    <p>
      floor, a beau-ti-ful place to play
    </p>
    <p>
      mar-bles, blind-man's-buff and,
    </p>
    <p>
      Kit-ty-kit-ty-cor-ner. They al-
    </p>
    <p>
      ways ate from the same egg,
    </p>
    <p>
      and as Farm-er Jones kept his
    </p>
    <p>
      cats at the barn, there was
    </p>
    <p>
      noth-ing to spoil their com-
    </p>
    <p>
      fort for many years.

      go hun-gry, or cold, or had
    </p>
    <p>
      been scold-ed, they'd have
    </p>
    <p>
      been cross, naught-y dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Floss and Fluff had
    </p>
    <p>
      good mas-ter. He was a
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle boy on-ly six years
    </p>
    <p>
      old, but he was a first-rate
    </p>
    <p>
      mas-ter. His pa-pa said when
    </p>
    <p>
      he brought Floss and Fluff
    </p>
    <p>
      home:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Fred-dy, just as
    </p>
    <p>
      long as these lit-tle fel-lows
    </p>
    <p>
      are hap-py, just so long they
    </p>
    <p>
      are yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred-dy knew what that
    </p>
    <p>
      meant. He fed his beau-ti-ful
    </p>
    <p>
      pets at reg-u-lar hours ev-er-y
    </p>
    <p>
      day, and e-ver-y day he combed
    </p>
    <p>
      and brushed them, and ev-er-y
    </p>
    <p>
      day he took them out for a
    </p>
    <p>
      a frol-ic, and they had their
    </p>
    <p>
      baths at the right time, and
    </p>
    <p>
      he nev-er held up a bone and
    </p>
    <p>
      did not give it to them. Be-
    </p>
    <p>
      cause he was so prompt and
    </p>
    <p>
      true and kind, Fred-dy was
    </p>
    <p>
      hap-py, and so were Fluff
    </p>
    <p>
      and Floss.

      The ba-by in the house and
    </p>
    <p>
      the ba-by in the barn, are
    </p>
    <p>
      great friends. The barn ba-
    </p>
    <p>
      by is not per-mit-ted to come
    </p>
    <p>
      in-to the house, but the house
    </p>
    <p>
      ba-by vis-its the barn ev-er-y
    </p>
    <p>
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house ba-by is a year
    </p>
    <p>
      old, and the barn ba-by is
    </p>
    <p>
      just a year old too; but the
    </p>
    <p>
      house ba-by can on-ly take
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle trem-bling steps, hold-
    </p>
    <p>
      ing fast by moth-er's hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      while the barn ba-by, if he
    </p>
    <p>
      can on-ly get out of doors,
    </p>
    <p>
      throws up his heels and runs
    </p>
    <p>
      a-cross the fields, and no-bod-y
    </p>
    <p>
      can catch him. The house
    </p>
    <p>
      ba-by laughs to see him go, and
    </p>
    <p>
      dear-ly likes his red hair, and
    </p>
    <p>
      feel his two stout lit-tle horns,
    </p>
    <p>
      And I think the barn ba-by likes to
    </p>
    <p>
      feel the soft hand of
    </p>
    <p>
      his lit-tle
    </p>
    <p>
      friend
    </p>
    <p>
      from the
    </p>
    <p>
      house, for
    </p>
    <p>
      some-times
    </p>
    <p>
      there is salt, and
    </p>
    <p>
      some-times there
    </p>
    <p>
      is su-gar on the
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle pink palm,
    </p>
    <p>
      and the barn ba-
    </p>
    <p>
      by licks it off
    </p>
    <p>
      with his rough
    </p>
    <p>
      tongue. Once the barn ba-by
    </p>
    <p>
      tried to say, "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried this way: He reached
    </p>
    <p>
      his head up and licked the
    </p>
    <p>
      house ba-by's rose-pink cheek. The
    </p>
    <p>
      house ba-by was scared, and so was the
    </p>
    <p>
      house ba-by's moth-er&mdash;and she ran in-to
    </p>
    <p>
      the house with him just as fast as she could; and
    </p>
    <p>
      then pa-pa laughed at them both, and the barn ba-by
    </p>
    <p>
      stood and looked over the fence for half an hour.

    <h2>
      BO-PEEP'S STOCK-ING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bo-peep was Jack Hor-ner's
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle sis-ter. When he had
    </p>
    <p>
      his Christ-mas pie she was a
    </p>
    <p>
      wee ba-by. But the next
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ-mas, mam-ma hung up
    </p>
    <p>
      her own lit-tle red-and-white
    </p>
    <p>
      speck-led stock-ing for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ-mas morning there
    </p>
    <p>
      was a great time. Bo-peep
    </p>
    <p>
      sat on the bed, and shouted
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goo! goo!" and pulled the
    </p>
    <p>
      things out her-self from the
    </p>
    <p>
      gay lit-tle stuffed stock-ing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lit-tle white rab-bit peeped
    </p>
    <p>
      out at the top. His eyes were
    </p>
    <p>
      made of pink beads. He had
    </p>
    <p>
      a clov-er leaf in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a chi-na pus-sy,
    </p>
    <p>
      black and yel-low and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a brown mouse and a
    </p>
    <p>
      white one. The brown mouse
    </p>
    <p>
      was choc-o-late. The white
    </p>
    <p>
      one was su-gar: and Bo-peep
    </p>
    <p>
      bit off the choc-o-late tail
    </p>
    <p>
      and a su-gar ear at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knit dol-ly, in
    </p>
    <p>
      a bright blue dress and blue
    </p>
    <p>
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a-way down in the toe
    </p>
    <p>
      of the stock-ing, there was a
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle chi-na hen. She sat in
    </p>
    <p>
      her nest. The nest was chi-na
    </p>
    <p>
      too. Bo-peep took her off, and
    </p>
    <p>
      what do you think she had for
    </p>
    <p>
      eggs? Pink-and-white car-a-
    </p>
    <p>
      way seeds!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bo-peep went to bed
    </p>
    <p>
      that night, the lit-tle red stock-
    </p>
    <p>
      ing was left on the car-pet. In
    </p>
    <p>
      the morn-ing mam-ma heard a
    </p>
    <p>
      rus-tle in the stock-ing, and
    </p>
    <p>
      shook it. Out ran a gray
    </p>
    <p>
      mous-ie, a real, live mous-ie!
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three of Bo-peep's
    </p>
    <p>
      lit-tle pink-and-white car-a-way
    </p>
    <p>
      eggs had stayed in the toe of
    </p>
    <p>
      the stock-ino-. Mous-ie had
    </p>
    <p>
      smelt them in the night, and had
    </p>
    <p>
      crept in to get his share of Christ-mas
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bo-peep thinks she had
    </p>
    <p>
      two Christ-mas morn-ings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't that fun-ny?
